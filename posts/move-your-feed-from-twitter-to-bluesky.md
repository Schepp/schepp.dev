As we all know X, née Twitter, is turning more and more into a shitshow. Time to move on to other platforms! Sadly, the people I used to follow flock into all sorts of directions: be it LinkedIn, Mastodon, Bluesky or all of them. So here I am on Bluesky: [@schepp.dev](https://bsky.app/profile/schepp.dev). 

After having made that first step I wondered if there was an easy way to reconnect with everyone I followed on X, ideally in an automated way as I follow almost 5.000 people on Twitter/X.

Luckily there is a Chrome browser plugin called [Sky Follower Bridge](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sky-follower-bridge/behhbpbpmailcnfbjagknjngnfdojpko) that does everything for you. This is how it works:

## Reinstating your Twitter/X followings on Bluesky

1. Open (or [install](https://www.google.com/chrome/)) the Chrome browser and install the [Sky Follower Bridge](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sky-follower-bridge/behhbpbpmailcnfbjagknjngnfdojpko) extension. You should see a new icon appear in your browser bar at the top: ![The image shows a simple, minimalistic icon resembling an "S" shape with rounded edges, primarily in blue gradient tones. The design could represent a path, route, or connection, potentially indicating movement or progression, commonly seen in navigation or travel-related applications.](/img/sky-follower-bridge-icon.png)
2. Then go to your Twitter/X "[Following](https://twitter.com/following)" page, click the icon, feed it with your Bluesky account handle and a Bluesky app password, which you can generate [here](https://bsky.app/settings/app-passwords), and finally click "Find Bluesky Users": <br>![The image shows a login interface for "Sky Follower Bridge." It has fields for entering a handle or email and a password, with the handle pre-filled as "@derschepp.bsky.social." Below the password field, there’s a recommendation to use an "App Password." At the bottom, there’s a large blue button labeled "Find Bluesky Users" for initiating the search.](/img/sky-follower-bridge-button.png)
3. Then it'll scan all your followings bit by bit and is going to try to find them on Bluesky. That might take some time: <br>![The image shows a user interface indicating that "1374 users" have been detected. Below this count, there is a prominent blue button labeled "View Detected Users" for viewing the list of identified users. Additionally, there is an option below the button labeled "Resume Scanning," allowing the user to continue the scan process if needed.](/img/sky-follower-bridge-scan.png)
4. Finally it'll present you with its findings. You can now go through the list and click "Follow on Bluesky" for each user you are interested in. If you want to follow them all then click the button "Follow all" on the lower left: <br>![The image displays a user interface for the "Sky Follower Bridge," showing a list of 1374 detected users on Bluesky. The left side includes filters for refining the list, such as "Followed users," "Same handle name," "Same display name," and "Included handle name in description," all of which are toggled on. Below these filters, there's an "Action" section with a prominent "Follow All" button. On the right, individual users are displayed with their profile information, handle, and a "Follow on Bluesky" button next to each entry, indicating the option to follow them directly.](/img/sky-follower-bridge-follow-all.png)
5. And, boom, you are done!
