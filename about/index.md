![me with weird glasses on my head](/img/schepp-2019.jpg)

Christian Schaefer, known as "Schepp" [@derSchepp](https://twitter.com/derSchepp), is a freelance frontend developer from DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany. Instead of hacking around with JS-Frameworks as almost every other frontend developer currently does, he works on traditional server-rendered component-based systems, uses bleeding edge CSS, has an eye on accessibility as well as the loading and runtime performance of a site. And then he also organizes the [Webworker NRW Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Webworker-NRW/), the [localhost conference](https://localhost.engineering/) and co-hosts the [Working Draft Podcast](https://workingdraft.de/).
