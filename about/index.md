Christian Schaefer, known as "Schepp" [@derSchepp](https://twitter.com/derSchepp), is a freelance frontend developer from Düsseldorf, Germany. Instead of hacking around with JS-Frameworks as almost every other frontend developer currently does, he works on traditional server-rendered component-based systems, uses bleeding edge CSS, has an eye on accessibility as well as the loading and runtime performance of a site. All of which didn't stop him from meshing up his own client-side renderer, based on Twig.js, Web Workers, Redux and MorphDOM. When he's not at a client he co-organizes the [CSS Café](https://www.meetup.com/CSS-Cafe/), organizes the [Webworker NRW](https://www.meetup.com/Webworker-NRW/) and [CSS Café](https://www.meetup.com/CSS-Cafe/) meetups, the [localhost conference](https://localhost.engineering/) and co-hosts the [Working Draft Podcast](https://workingdraft.de/).
